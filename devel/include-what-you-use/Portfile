description         ensures that every symbol used in a C++ file has a \
                    corresponding include directive
long_description    "Include what you use" means this: for every symbol (type, \
                    function, variable, or macro) that you use in foo.cc (or \
                    foo.cpp), either foo.cc or foo.h should include a .h file \
                    that exports the declaration of that symbol. (Similarly, \
                    for foo_test.cc, either foo_test.cc or foo.h should do the \
                    including.) Obviously symbols defined in foo.cc itself are \
                    excluded from this requirement. This puts us in a state \
                    where every file includes the headers it needs to declare \
                    the symbols that it uses. When every file includes what it \
                    uses, then it is possible to edit any file and remove \
                    unused headers, without fear of accidentally breaking the \
                    upwards dependencies of that file. It also becomes easy to \
                    automatically track and update dependencies in the source \
                    code.
